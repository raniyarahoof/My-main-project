## 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on the exploration and analysis of healthcare data to identify key patterns, operational insights, and performance indicators within the healthcare system.
The primary objective is to transform raw patient and service-related data into meaningful information that supports data-driven decisions.
The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of clear visualizations to highlight trends across patient demographics, billing segments, service utilization, and departmental activities. 
Insights derived from this analysis can help improve hospital workflow efficiency, enhance patient care strategies, and optimize resource allocation.
This repository is structured to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and ease of understanding for anyone interested in healthcare analytics or applied data analysis
